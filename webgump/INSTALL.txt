In order to run webgump, you need to get and install

  * Apache2
  * mod_python

into its directory tree. The following command might work
if you're on unix:

  cd $GUMP_HOME
  ./gump webgump get-apache

but its not really tested all that well, so be prepared to
read the script

  webgump/bin/get-apache

and execute the equivalent steps manually. Good luck!
