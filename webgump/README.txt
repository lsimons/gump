Welcome to WebGump!

Webgump is a small experiment in building a python-based web application. It's mainly meant to contrast against dynagump (dynagump big, webgump 
small), while both at the moment don't really do anything. It should serve as a discussion starter on the web side of things. Real options include

  * dynagump-style  (dynamic)
  * webgump-style   (dynamic)
  * gump2-style     (generated)
  * gump2-old-style (generated by forrest)
  * using some other ready made python framework
  * using some other ready made java framework
