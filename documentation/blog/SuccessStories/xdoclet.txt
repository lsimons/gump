XDoclet is one of the projects which Antoine likes to see build in Gump,
because he is interested in getting the ant-xdocs-proposal to build.
A small project, with a lot of dependencies.
</p>
<more/>
<p>
On the 24th of March, Antoine changed the gump descriptor of xdoclet
to make it squeeze the dependency checking to xjavadoc.
The build of xdoclet has otherwise the nasty habit of venturing into
the ../xjavadoc directory to build javadoc, but this does not work
and also should not be done during gump runs.
</p>
<p>
On the 26th of March, xdoclet's build was failing with gumpy.
The xdoclet-xdoclet subproject was recursively looping in a target.
A look at the xdoclet build files show that they are not simple, to say the list.
Xdoclet uses a custom ant task which is a kind of subant with dependency 
checking called builder, implemented by the class xdoclet.ant.modulesbuilder.ModulesGrandBuilderTask
(without pretention).
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Adam Jack fixed gumpy on the 28th, by implementing sysproperty there
similarly to gump, which fixed the build problem.

30th of March, 2004
Some amount of human nagging, including nagging to the list and some
more direct personal nags also allowed  to get the xjavadoc.jar file location
to get it's own property in the build file of xdoclet.
Antoine changed the gump descriptor of xdoclet again to tell ant where the xjavadoc jar lives.
</p>
<p>
There might be a number of new changes to do in this build, to make it less complex.
I wonder whether the builder task of xdoclet could be replaced by <subant/> or something
similar.
