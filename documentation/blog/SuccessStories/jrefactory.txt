<h3>
issue of line ending with PrettyPrinter task
</h3>
<p>
Antoine L&eacute;vy-Lambert  had found a problem with the PrettyPrinter task supplied by 
<a href="http://jrefactory.sourceforge.net/">JRefactory</a>.
Without any clear announcement, the JRefactory team had changed their 
<a href="http://jrefactory.sourceforge.net/Main_components_prettyprint.html">PrettyPrinter
task</a> to delegate processing of line endings to the ant fixcrlf task - which is good.
<more/>
As a consequence, the acceptable values for the lineending setting of PrettyPrinter
changed to become the one's of ant's fixcrlf task.
</p><p>
This caused the build of xdoclet to fail around mid January.
</p><p>
Antoine entered a bug report in the bug tracking system of JRefactory,
and also asked the xdoclet team to adapt their build file to the new behavior of
PrettyPrinter, which they did.

pretty.settings end.line property comments need a fix</a>
</p><p>
Mike Atkinson seems to have worked on this issue yesterday (March 25th 2004).

<h3>
jaxen/saxpath changes
</h3>
<p>
Due to changes in jaxen, which has absorbed saxpath, JRefactory had
a compilation failure.
</p><p>
Antoine sent a mail to the JRefactory mailing list on the 24th of March,
and Mike Atkinson fixed the faulty org.acm.seguin.pmd.jaxen.DocumentNavigator
yesterday (March 25th).
</p><p>
So, yes, human nagging is effective. When it is effective, and how you do 
it diplomatically is another issue.
