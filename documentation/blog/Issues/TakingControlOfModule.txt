<p>Recently the Avalon build on gump has been failing because of a missconfigured module.xml
Avalon keeps it module.xml in it's cvs at ??
</p>
<p>Avalon has not been responsive to making changes to this 
file but many other project in gump relay on it so we considered taking 
moving it's module.xml to the gump cvs.
<p>In general gump preferrs module.xml to be kept in it's cvs where all of apache can 
keep it uptodate and running.  However we defer to what ever a project wants as 
long as the greater community is served.   For gump that means, succesfull builds.

[So what did we do ?]
