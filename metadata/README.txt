WATCH OUT! This is a highly tailored snapshot of the metadata in CVS. Don't edit.
Edit the stuff in the gump CVS module  instead. We're using a snapshot just to make
it all a little more predictable.

For Gump3 developers only, you might want to take a look at the giraffe.xml profile
and start working with that (copy it to your own `hostname`.xml file or link to it
on the command line). It's currently our main "integration test" profile.
