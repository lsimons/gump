   Gump code currently resides in SVN, yet Gump metadata still resides in CVS.

   There is no way for SVN to automatically fetch an external CVS repository
   so you have to do it yourself by checking out the "gump" CVS module, which
   is normally obtained by doing

      cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co gump

   in the current folder.

   Enjoy.
