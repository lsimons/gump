<h1>How To Run Your Own Gump</h1>
<p>Please note that this documentation specifies the plans we have,
rather than what we actually do right now. The key difference is that
Gump will be made much more intelligent about whom to send what e-mail
and what to put in those e-mails. However, the basic ideas for all this
are quickly falling into place.<br>
</p>
<h2>Why do it?</h2>
<p>Maybe you want to use gump on your own software that isn't built by
gump itself (perhaps its closed-source). Maybe you're a gump developer
and you want to test out changes locally. Maybe you just want to
understand better how gump works. Maybe you want to run a copy of the
main gump installation using a different operating system. There are
lots of reasons, really.<br>
</p>
<h2>Required knowledge</h2>
<p>To be able to run gump you should have understand the basics of what
gump is all about.
You should also have some experience with cvs, subversion, the command
line
and xml. Python experience is not required.<br>
</p>
<h2>Required software</h2>
<p>Gump needs a unix-like environment. Prerequisites include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Bash shell;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Python 2.3 or later;</li>
  <li>the pkill program;</li>
  <li>the hostname program;</li>
  <li>the cvs program;</li>
  <li>the svn program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional software includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the rdflib python library for outputting RSS feeds;<br>
  </li>
  <li>a java development kit (jdk) for building java software;</li>
  <li>the Apache Ant program for building java software;</li>
  <li>the Apache Maven program for building java software;</li>
  <li>the make,automake,autoconf,gcc programs and related tools for
building many other kinds of software;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the xmllint program for checking the gump metadata validity;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the xsltproc program for checking the gump metadata validity;<br>
  </li>
  <li>the Apache Forrest program for generating html from the results
and building the gump website;</li>
</ul>
<p>The gump command line tool tries to be intelligent about detecting
the
availability of these tools. As long as you have bash, cvs, svn and
hostname available it should be able to guide you to the right
locations
for getting these libraries.</p>
<p>For Debian users, it is mostly possible to mirror the main gump
installation by following the procedures described on
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/gump/BrutusConfig">this page</a>.</p>
<h2>Downloading the sources</h2>
<p>Gump doesn't publish distributions. Instead, you need to check it
out from cvs/svn:<br>
</p>
<pre>$ mkdir ~/gump/local<br>$ cd ~/gump/local<br>$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/trunk .<br>$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login<br># password is "anoncvs"<br>$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout gump<br>$ mv gump/* metadata<br>$ rm -Rf gump<br></pre>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Setting up your environment</h2>
<p>The next step is to let gump know about your computer. Create a file
named <code>~/gump/local/cron/local-env-${HOST}.sh</code>, where <code>${HOST}</code>
should be replaced with the short name of your computer (ie the part
before the first "."). You can find your hostname using the command <code>hostname
-s</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>This file is a bash script which gets read by gump everytime it is
run, before it does anything significant. In it, you can define
environment variables by exporting them. For now, we'll define only the
required <code>GUMP_HOME</code> and a <code>JAVA_HOME</code> because
we will be building a java project:<br>
</p>
<pre>export GUMP_HOME=~/gump/local<br>export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home<br></pre>
<h2>The gump command line</h2>
<p>Your main interface into gump will be the command line program
named, aptly, <code>gump</code>. You can find out about its basic
functionality using the "help" command:<br>
</p>
<pre>$ cd ~/gump/local<br>$ ./gump help<br><br>      Utility commandline interface for Gump.<br>     <br>      Usage:<br>        ./gump command [opts ...]<br>     <br>      Available commands are:<br>     <br>        run -- run Gumpy<br>        test -- run Gumpy its unit tests<br>        get-metadata -- Check out or update metadata from CVS<br>        validate -- validate the metadata<br>        help -- print this information<br>        site -- use Apache Forrest to build the documentation<br>        site-publish -- use SVN and SSH to publish the site to the website<br>     <br>      Run<br>     <br>        ./gump help [command]<br>     <br>      for more information about a particular command.<br></pre>
<p>Note that you need to <code>cd</code> into the <code>GUMP_HOME</code>
directory before
executing this command. (Yes, we know that's annoying.) One thing you
might wish to do is use a small wrapper script that you place
elsewhere, ie you could create the following as <code>~/bin/gump</code>
(assuming
<code>~/bin</code> is on your path):<br>
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh<br>#<br># Simple wrapper script which fires off gump<br>olddir=`pwd`<br>cd ~/local/gump<br>./gump $@<br>cd $olddir<br></pre>
<h2>Running the unit tests</h2>
<p>Next, we'll run the gump unit tests using the command line
interface. It would be nice if these tests would all always work, but
this isn't the case, so simply don't worry if some of them fail:<br>
</p>
<pre>cd ~/gump/local<br>./gump test<br></pre>
<p>If the test suite gets run, that means you have all the neccessary
prerequisites available. Finally! Now comes the fun bit.<br>
</p>
<h2>Defining a workspace and a profile</h2>
<p>Gump reads an xml file from <code>GUMP_HOME/metadata</code> that
should be named <code>${HOST}.xml</code>. This file defines a <em>workspace</em>,
where you can customize
just about everything about gump's behaviour. For now, simply copy the
<code>minimal-workspace.xml</code> file that's in CVS into <code>${HOST}.xml</code>.
This file
references a profile definition. The profile defines what stuff
gump will build. The file referenced is <code>profile/minimal-profile.xml</code>,
which builds Apache Ant, and nothing else.<br>
</p>
<h2>Running gump</h2>
<p>Pfew. You're still here? Good. Let's do an actual "gump run":</p>
<pre>cd ~/local/gump<br>./gump run<br></pre>
<p>This will take quite a while, with surprisingly little output on the
screen. Because gump is architected to be run from cronjobs, it sends
all
its output to logfiles. The main one to look at for now is <code>log/gump_log.txt</code>.
However, most of the gump logs are output as HTML, so you'll normally
will want to
take a look at <code>log/index.html</code> using your web browser. Be
aware that every new gump run overwrites these logs so if you want to
keep a particular run make sure to make a copy of the logs somewhere.</p>
<h2>It doesn't work!</h2>
<p>Don't worry, that's normal :-D. Since gump is about "bleeding edge"
by
design, things tend to break a lot. Just pop on over on the general
_at_ gump _dot_
apache _dot_ org mailing list and ask what's going on.</p>
