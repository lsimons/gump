  <title>An introduction to Gump</title>

<body>
<h1>An introduction to Gump</h1>
<p>Gump is Apache's continuous integration tool. It is written in
python
and fully supports Apache Ant, Apache Maven and other build tools. Gump
is unique in that it builds and compiles software against the latest
development versions of those projects. This allows gump to detect
potentially incompatible changes to that software just a few hours
after those changes are checked into the version control system.
Notifications are sent to the project team as soon as such a change is
detected, referencing more detailed reports available online.</p>
<p>You can set up and run Gump on your own machine and run it on your
own
projects, however it is currently most famous for building most of
Apache's java-based projects and their dependencies (which constitutes
several million lines of code split up into hundreds of projects). For
this purpose, the gump project maintains its own dedicated server.<br>
</p>
<h1>Getting the information you need</h1>
<p>Gump is not a trivial project. We compile thousands of sourcefiles
every night, and try to send the right reports to hundreds of projects
when something bad happens. This means that there's a lot to "get"
about gump. We've tried to split the documentation up into useful parts
based on their target audience. The following is available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="HowGumpWorks.html">How Gump Works</a> -- an explanation
of how Gump goes about its job, giving both a 50,000 feet overview and
some information on our design goals and philosophy.</li>
  <li><a href="HowToFixGumpBuildProblems.html">How To Fix Gump Build
Problems</a>
-- this document explains the steps you should take if gump send you or
a project you participated in an e-mail.</li>
  <li><a href="HowToGetBuiltByGump.html">How To Get Built By Gump</a>
-- this document explains how to add new projects to gump, focussing
mostly on the gump object model, our xml descriptors that tell gump how
to "do its thing".</li>
  <li><a href="https://gump.apache.org/metadata/index.html">Gump Object
Model
Reference</a> -- this document details the entire gump object model.</li>
