                benefit from the service (but you don't have time to look deeper into

                Here is how to start.</td>

    <section><title>Planning</title>
      <p>The bare minimum required to get started is a JDK, a JAXP 1.1
      compliant parser, a command prompt (bash or Windows NT/2K), and Perl.
      Perl is only used at the moment for some of the publishing and
      notification, so it can be omitted.</p>
      
      <p>It is highly recommended at this point that you review the
      description of the data definitions used by Gump, starting with
      the <link href="site:om/overview">overview</link>.</p>
      
      <section><title>Pre-requisites</title>
      	<section><title>Source Control System</title>
      	<p>One of these two is required.</p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>CVS -- Concurrent Versioning System</li>
      		<li>SVN -- <fork href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</fork></li>
      	</ul>
      	</section>
      	<section><title>Jar Downloading</title>
      	<p>This is optional.</p>

    <section><title>Getting the source to Gump</title>
      <source>
      export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic
      cvs login
      cvs co gump
      </source>

      <p>If prompted for the password, enter <strong>anoncvs</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Defining your workspace</title>
      <p>Sample workspaces are provided, 'gump' and 'minimal-workspace'.  Find 
      take one an edit it to fit your environment/needs.  The suggested
      name for the file you create is your host name.</p>

      <p>Again, reference the <link href="site:om/overview">overview</link> to see
      how you can add projects, define your own profiles, and the modify
      which version of referenced projects you want to build.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Installing Packages</title>
      <p>Packages for which source is not easily accessible are not built by Gump.
      Where such packages are required prerequisites for building other projects, Gump
      allows binary versions of the package to be installed to satisfy the prerequisites.
      Your workspace definition specifies where installed packages are to be found.
      </p>

      <p>A list of some of the packages you might want to install can be found
      <link href="http://brutus.apache.org/gump/public/packages.html">
      here</link>.</p>

      <p><strong>JDK 1.4</strong> includes both <code>jaxp</code> and <code>jsse</code>
      which were previously available as separately installable packaged.
      The dependencies on these packages are now marked as optional. If you are
      using a JDK prior to 1.4, the packages must be installed. For JDK 1.4 and
      later the packages need not be installed and the version provided with the
      JDK will be utilised.
