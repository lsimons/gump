    <p>Specifies the arguments to be passed to <fork href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</fork>.</p>
    
    <warning>This is an experimental component, changes may occur. 
    	
    	Only Python Gump supports &lt;maven.
    	    	
    	The biggest known limitation of this component is the naming of artefacts; how
    	Maven knows them, how Gump knows them, and if those two worldviews intersect.</warning>
    
    <p>
    	The <fork href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</fork> component of Gump (&lt;maven) is experiment, and uses a <strong>pre-installed</strong>
		version of <fork href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</fork>, is does <strong>NOT</strong> bootstrap Maven from CVS HEAD. This is
		hopefully something that will be added in the future.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	 Gump generates a <strong>build.properties</strong> file for Maven, in which is specifies the jar
		 overrides, and also any <link href="project.html#property">properties</link> that are passes into
		 the &lt;maven element.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	Currently Gump does <strong>not</strong> read the Maven project.xml (POM) to attempt to determine
    	dependencies, the Gump descriptor needs to have them. The 'gump' goal in Maven
    	ought generate such a file.
    </p>
