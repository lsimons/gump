  Gump XML model.

  It contains a sax dispatcher tool, a dependency
  walker, and an object model (GOM) which is built from an xmlfile using
  the sax dispatcher.

  The idea is that a subclass of GumpModelObject is used for each of the various
  xml tags which can appear in a gump profile, with a saxdispatcher
  generating a tree of GumpModelObject objects from the profile, dynamically
  merging as it finds href references.

  You can then use the dependencies() method to get an ordered, flat vector
  of the projects in the profile.

  Then there's some basic procedures to work with the GOM, like load().

  For basic usage patterns, look at the gump.view module or the gump.build
  module.
