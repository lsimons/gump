    This is an example of a testcase. Simply copy and rename this file
    (the filename has to start with "test"), then rename the class below,
    update the reference to the classname in the test_suite() method,
    and write your test methods.
    
    See the documentation for the unittest package for more help with
    tests. You can run all tests from the commandline using "./gump test".
