  <section name="Recurring build problems">
    <p>These represent "known problems".  In some cases, they represent a
    temporary problem that will be synched up at the point of the next
    release, in other cases they may represent an abject failure to
    communicate.</p>

    <subsection name="jakarta-cactus">
      <p>Generally the Tomcat tests for 22, and *sometimes* 23, fail on 
      Solaris.  Current status can be found
      <a href="http://gump.covalent.net/log/jakarta-cactus-22.html">here</a>.
      </p>

    <subsection name="jakarta-turbine">
      <p>The various turbine implementations are coded directly to the
      xml-xerces1 API and will not survive intact to Xerces 2.  A
      <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=turbine-dev&amp;m=100673562207077&amp;w=2">patch</a>
      enabling pluggable parser support for one such component (torque) was
      prepared in November, but has never been applied.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="xml-xerces2">
      <p>The tests for xml-security and xml-xalan2, both of which pass cleanly
      with xerces1, fail with xerces2.</p>
      <p>A complete gump run using xerces2 can be found
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/~rubys/gump/xerces2/">here</a>.</p>

  <section name="Other Issues">
    <p>These represent versioning issues that will not show up in any
    Gump run, but you may need to be aware.</p>

    <subsection name="jakarta-turbine">
      <p>Based on inspection, I don't believe that turbine-2 and turbine-3 can
      coexist in a classpath.  The jakarta-jetspeed, jakarta-turbine-jyve, and
      jakarta-turbine-orgami projects depend on turbine-2.  The
      jakarta-turbine-flux project depends on turbine-3.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="jakarta-velocity">
      <p>The combination of Texen, Ant 1.4 or later, and placing jars on your
      classpath can result in unexpected behavior.  This has been isolated
      to a standalone 
      <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-dev&amp;m=100264908721443&amp;w=2">test case</a> 
      and being investigated by the Ant development team.  Meanwhile, an 
      undocumented attribute, reverseloader, which when set to the value "true"
      on taskdefs which defines texen may help.</p>

  <section name="Recent success stories">
    <p>This section describes cross project compatibility issues which were:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>detected by Gump</li>
      <li>the changes would likely have otherwise gone undetected until
      release</li>
      <li>involved changes to one or both products</li>
      <li>the changes were done prior to release.</li>
    </ul>

    <subsection name="dbxml">
      <p>October 2001: The Xalan team is in the process of changing an 
      undocumented API that dbXML used.  The dbXML team determined that the
      reason that they were using that undocumented API no longer applies.
      This was corrected after the second beta of dbXML - meaning that the
      users of their next release will be able to upgrade smoothly to
      Xalan 2.2 once it is released.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="jakarta-log4j">
      <p>September 2001: in order to more closely resemble the JSR 47 API,
      the Level class replaced the Priority class, and the Logger class
      replaced the Category class.  This was originally done in a manner which
      was thought to be backwards compatible, but there was subtle reasons why
      this was not the case.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="jakarta-ant">
      <p>December 2001: a manifest task was added to Ant which collided with
      the manifest task contained within xml-fop.  What followed was the most
      impressive cooperation between projects I have ever witnessed.  The fop
      project removed their manifest task, and the Ant project changed their
      code so that the manifest task that fop previous had would have
      overridden the one provided with Ant.</p>
