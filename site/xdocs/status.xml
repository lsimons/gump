  <section name="Recurring build problems">
    <p>These represent "known problems".  In some cases, they represent a
    temporary problem that will be synched up at the point of the next
    release, in other cases they may represent an abject failure to
    communicate.</p>

    <subsection name="jakarta-velocity-test">
      <p><a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-velocity/src/java/org/apache/velocity/texen/ant/TexenTask.java.diff?r1=1.31&amp;r2=1.32">This</a>
      change apparently is not compatible with Velocity being on the
      classpath with Ant 1.4.</p>

    <subsection name="openejb">
      <p>In Junit 3.7, a previously protected method was made public,
      impacting extenders of junit.textui.TestRunner.  A 
      <a href="http://openejb.exolab.org/list-archive/msg01404.html">patch</a>
      was provided to them that worked with both the release that they are 
      using (3.5) and the current release.  No acknowledgement of the patch was
      received.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="xml-fop">
      <p>Batik is in the process of correcting what they have described as
      a fairly fundamental design error.  This should only affect a small
      minority of batik users.  Unfortunately, xml-fop is one of the users
      affected.</p>
      <p>At the present time, there is a good line of communication between
      the two projects, and the fop team understands and agrees to this change.
      They have already resynched once, and will try to track to the
      release.</p>

  <section name="Other Issues">
    <p>These represent versioning issues that will not show up in any
    gump run, but you may need to be aware.</p>

    <subsection name="jakarta-tomcat-4.0">
      <p>Tomcat4 integration with tyrex depends on interfaces which tyrex
      removed over six months ago.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="jakarta-turbine">
      <p>Based on inspection, I don't believe that turbine-2 and turbine-3 can
      coexist in a classpath.  The jakarta-jetspeed, jakarta-turbine-jyve, and
      jakarta-turbine-orgami projects depend on turbine-2.  The
      jakarta-turbine-flux project depends on turbine-3.</p>

  <section name="Recent success stories">
    <p>This section describes cross project compatibility issues which were:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>detected by gump</li>
      <li>the changes would likely have otherwise gone undetected until
      release</li>
      <li>involved changes to one or both products</li>
      <li>the changes were done prior to release.</li>
    </ul>

    <subsection name="dbxml">
      <p>October 2001: The Xalan team is in the process of changing an 
      undocumented API that dbxml used.  The dbxml team determined that the
      reason that they were using that undocumented API no longer applies.
      This was corrected after the second beta of dbXML - meaning that the
      users of their next release will be able to upgrade smoothly to
      Xalan 2.2 once it is released.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="jakarta-log4j">
      <p>September 2001: in order to more closely resemble the JSR 47 API,
      the Level class replaced the Priority class, and the Logger class
      replaced the Category class.  This was originally done in a manner which
      was thought to be backwards compatible, but there was subtle reasons why
      this was not the case.</p>
