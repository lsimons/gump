  <section name="project">
    <p>A project is the atomic unit of integration.  It can describe an
    installable package or a buildable product.  The nested elements of
    a project definition fall into three different "groups", each optional:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Build instructions: &lt;ant&gt; and &lt;script&gt;.  Describes how to
    produce the outputs from the inputs.</li>
    <li>Inputs: &lt;depend&gt;, &lt;option&gt;, and &lt;work&gt;.  Describes
    where to find the inputs (primarily jar files, but can be directories and
    files).</li>
    <li>Outputs: &lt;home&gt; and &lt;jar&gt;.  Describes where to locate
    the output files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that &lt;depend&gt; elements nested within &lt;ant&gt;
    elements are precisely equivalent to specifying both a property to be
    passed to Ant, as well as a separate depend element.</p>

      <p>Identifies this project as "buildable", and specifies the

    <subsection name="script">
      <p>Identifies this project as "buildable", and specifies the
      script to be executed in order to make this happen.  The assumption
      is that the script can be invoked in a platform independent manner,
      though the contents of the script may be platform specific.
      Specifically, if the name of the script is "name", it will be
      invoked as follows:</p>

      <p>At the present time, the only use of this is during the bootstrap
      process for Ant.</p>

      <p>For a build "all", the invocation of ant or the script is bypassed
      if any of the outputs of the specified project can not be found.</p>

      <p>For both script and ant based builds, any jars defined by the

      the build, the behavior of the JVM may become unpredictable.</p>
