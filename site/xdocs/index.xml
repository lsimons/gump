  <section name="What is Gump?">

  <p>
    Gump is a social experiment.  The primary goal of Gump is to get diverse
    projects to communicate early and often about integration, dependencies,
    and versioning management.  One way to think about it is that some of the
    concepts of
    <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme programming</a>
    applied to
    <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">
    Continuous Integration</a> on an unprecedented scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Essentially, the reasoning goes like this - if continuous integration is a
    good thing on a small project, why not apply it recursively and include all
    dependencies for which access to source is provided?

  <section name="How does Gump work?">
    <p>
      <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-alexandria/proposal/gump/project">
      Project</a> definitions are converted from XML to scripts native to the
      platform on which you are running.  These scripts execute cvs update
      commands for every module which contains a project being built, and
      invoke builds for each project in an order that ensures that dependencies
      are satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The commands use the actual build.xml files from the projects, but do
      not use the scripts or jar files checked into CVS.  Instead, the
      CLASSPATH is set and properties are passed on the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      The net effect is that every project is built every day with the latest
      version of every dependency - including the latest Ant, latest JUnit,
      latest XML parser.
    </p>

    <p>
      The results are captured into html pages that largely are consistent
      with the style of the Jakarta project.  An extensive amount of hypertext
      links are added to allow quick and easy navigation, and failures are
      color coded on the main build page.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Perl script which is driven off of a naglist will optionally send
      e-mails to various newsgroups upon matching strings being found in the
      build output.  This is typically used to alert developers of build
      failures.

  <section name="When does Gump run?">
    <p>
      For Gump to have the desired social affects, it must be predictable.
      For now, I have chosen to run Gump daily - with kickoff being midnight
      Pacific time.  Given the global scale of open source development, there
      is clearly no one time when everyone is inactive, but at least this
      catches most of the North American continent napping, and is early in
      the business day for most of Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I have been experimenting with a second server kindly donated
      by Sun and administered by Pier Fumagalli and Justyna Horwat.  After
      I'd complained quite a bit, Pier took pitty on my and made available
      a LOT of tmp space - backed by 3 gigs of RAM.  Doing my builds from
      there positively flies!.  For now, I've timed
      an automated run to be kicked off at noon Pacific time - exactly the
      midpoint between "official" runs.  Note that I often kick off partial
      builds and may even do a full run out of cycle, so the cvs updates logs
      may not capture all of the activity that has taken place since the
      previous run.
    </p>

  <section name="Who is Gump?">
    <p>
      Gump was named after
      <a href="http://www.ionet.net/~lesinokc/gump/gump.html">Forrest Gump</a>,
      the title character in a movie.  The process for building was to do a
      "Generate", followed by cvs "Updates", followed by a "Build All".  This
      was repetitive, so a command was created to combine these operations -
      and it was named "guba".  This sound this made when spoken reminded me
      of "Bubba Gump".
    </p>

    <p>
      This seemed oddly appropriate to me as much of the motivation I had
      derived from the frustrations I had building a project that I was and
      continue to be a big fan of - Cocoon.  The
      <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/faqs.html#faq-whyname">FAQ</a> for
      that project indicate that the project was named after a movie that the
      creator of that project was particularly fond of, so it seemed fitting
      that this effort would be named after a movie that I am fond of.
    </p>

    <p>
      A number of other fortunate coincidences have convinced me that this
      was the right choice for a name.  From the role of the feather in the
      opening and closing scenes (something I have adapted to the Apache
      feature for the Gump icon), the catch phase of "Stupid is as Stupid
      does" - something that captures the spirit of a large number of build
      errors caught by this process.  And most significantly to me - the
      wisdom passed on from Gump's mother that "Life is like a box of
      chocolates - you never know what you are going to get!".  I can think
      of no more apt description of a build process which takes the absolute
      latest versions of almost everything and attempts to build them together!
