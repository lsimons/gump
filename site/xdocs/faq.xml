              could never work, could it?  How can you debug anything when
              you have so many variables to deal with?</td>

              <td>It isn't as hard as it seems.  Getting it to work initially
              was done by incrementally adding one project at a time.  Keeping
              it working is only requires a small amount of effort over a long
              period of time.  
              <p>When builds are "mostly" clean and frequent, isolating
              problems is fairly easy.  Rollback projects one by one until the
              problem disappears, and then reapply changes within that project
              one by one until the problem reappears.  I've used this technique
              numerous times to produce test cases and patches to projects
              that I know virtually nothing about their internal design.</p>

              prior version is still actively supported, exceptions may be made.
              Otherwise, feel free to set up your own builds, with or without

              Simply check it out and commit your changes.  It is highly
              recommended that you build the "gen" target first of the
              provided build.xml in order to verify that your changes
              are syntatically correct.  Don't be scared... this takes
              only a minute and only  requires that you have ant and JDK
              1.4.  (or ant + xerces + xalan + JDK 1.2 or later).
