              could never work, could it?  How can you debug anything when
              you have so many variables to deal with?</td>

              <td>It isn't as hard as it seems.  Getting it to work initially
              was done by incrementally adding one project at a time.  Keeping
              it working is only requires a small amount of effort over a long
              period of time.  
              <p>When builds are "mostly" clean and frequent, isolating
              problems is fairly easy.  Rollback projects one by one until the
              problem disappears, and then reapply changes within that project
              one by one until the problem reappears.  I've used this technique
              numerous times to produce test cases and patches to projects
              that I know virtually nothing about their internal design.</p>

              prior version is still actively supported, exceptions may be made.
              Otherwise, feel free to set up your own builds, with or without

              When the project was completely XSLT based, it probably worked,
              but now that part is in Java, so it will require a small amount
              of code.  All that code is in one place, so it should be
              relatively straightforward to address this need.  There still
              will need to be a small amount of "locator" information in
              Gump, but the contents of the project definition could be
              elsewhere.

              information helpful and base decisions on the results), Gump
              itself does not enjoy a large development community.  Once more
              people actually run the tool themselves and a few submit an
              occasional patch, it will be.</p>

              smoldering in the Alexandria community will reignite, and a
              merging of the two code bases will make sense.</p>
