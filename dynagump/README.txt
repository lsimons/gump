  What is this?
  -------------

 DynaGump is a web application that provides a user-friendly access to 
 the data generated by Apache Gump. 



  Requirements
  ------------

  DynaGump requires:

   o  A Java 1.5 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.
   
   o  A MySQL installation (tested with 5.0.15).

   o  Apache Maven 2.0 or later (http://maven.apache.org) 



  How do I run DynaGump?
  ----------------------
  
   *) [download Sun's JTA 1.0.1B from http://java.sun.com/products/jta/]
   *) mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file>/jta-1_0_1B-classes.zip \
      -DgroupId=javax.transaction -DartifactId=jta -Dversion=1.0.1B -Dpackaging=jar
      
   *) create gump database and user if they do not exist already:

         mysqladmin create database gump
         mysql -u root -p gump < src/database/Gump3DB.sql
         echo "'GRANT ALL ON gump.* TO 'gump'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword'" | mysql -u root -p
         echo "FLUSH PRIVILEGES" | mysql -u root -p
    
      (changing the password to something else of course)
   *) let hibernate know about the db name / username / password by editing
   
         src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml

   *) optionally push sample data into database:
   
         mysql -u gump -p gump < src/database/Gump3TempDB.sql
