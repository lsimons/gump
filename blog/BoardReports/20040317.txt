<p>
Most of the past few weeks has been filled with infrastructure stuff. 
</p>
<more/>
<p>
We've successfully migrated 
<a href="http://gump.apache.org">web-site</a>, 
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/gump/">CVS module</a>, 
<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10457">bug-tracking</a>
 and the
<a href="http://gump.apache.org/mail.html"> mailing list</a> 
to gump.apache.org - many thanks to the infrastructure team for making 
the transition that smooth. 
</p><p>
All Apache committers have been Gump committers with the old setup and this 
still remains true. We want to get as many people involved as possible when 
it gets to maintaining the project metadata. This is the reason that we've been
sticking to CVS for now since we can reach most Apache committers that way. 
Gump will probably be one of the last projects that make the transition to 
Subversion. 
</p><p>
Work on the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/gump/Drafts/ProjectBylaws">project bylaws</a>
has started and we expect to have them ready for the
next board meeting. Gump is unique when it comes to committer status so we'll 
have to put some thoughts into the definition of that role. 
</p><p>
Gump has been quite successful in pointing out problems in some builds recently 
and we are happy that most of them have been resolved between projects easily. 
Our biggest problem right now is building 
<a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon</a>,
but this may be due to the 
fact that Gump is using a different build system than Avalon more than anything
else. Once Gump supports 
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> as a build option, things may become easier for
Avalon. 
</p><p>
We continue improving the Python rewrite of Gump and have come quite a long 
way already. Since nobody of us is anywhere near a Python guru, we may be doing
things far more complicated than necessary. Any help is welcome. 8-) 
</p><p>
The short-to-mid-term future steps for Gump are :
<ul>
<li>get dedicated ASF hardware to run Gump on - 
<i>currently working on getting it running on Moof but we are really 
looking forward to the new gump-dedicated machine</i>. 
</li>
<li>expand Gump's reach beyond building Java projects. 
</li>
<li>improve the way Gump works by trying to find an computationally 
feasible way to nagging the offender and not the offended, improve the 
usability/effectiveness of gump reports, find ways to increase adoption by 
making social pressure of nagging more effective and ease the effort 
required for users to update their project descriptors. 
</li>
<li>start thinking on how to provide feedback for legal dependencies checkings 
</ul>
