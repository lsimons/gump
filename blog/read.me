The Gump Project Team blog.

This is a CVS backed blojsom[1] blog.

To post a story to the blog simply create MyStory.txt file in one of the dirs.
The first line of the file is the Title of the story.  The rest is the body.
Any html is valid.  but try to keep it simple.

A cron jog on csm.chalko.com updates the blog from cvs every 15 minutes.
