Hi,

it seems as if the JDOM saga continues, XMLOutputter#setEncoding has
been removed leading to build failures in Velocity and Slide.  The
method has been deprecated in beta10rc1 (maybe even beta9) and people
are now expected to use the Format instead.

On the 20th of February, the Velocity team has adapted their code to this
last development in the JDOM saga.
Hopefully, when the sun will rise in Europe this morning, 
there will be again a Pea against the jakarta-velocity line on
the gump dashboard. (Rather than a carrot)
