<p>
After a few hours of debugging and thanks
to Leo for giving Vincent access to LSD, the cause was found. The hunt
is over!
</p><p>
The cause was: commons-httpclient
</p><p>
It works fine with version 2.0 of commons-httpclient but not with the
latest version from HEAD. Now, the hard part, is trying to understand
why httpclient has changed some API. Then the Cactus project will need
to decide whether it has to use the new way (thus forcing users to use
httpclient from HEAD) or ask nicely some Gump admin to install
commons-httpclient 2.0 and have the Cactus build depend on that.
