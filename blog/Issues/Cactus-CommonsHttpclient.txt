build 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cactus-dev%40jakarta.apache.org/msg04855.html">failed</a>
on Apache Gump.
After a few hours of debugging and thanks
to Leo for giving Vincent access to <a href="http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/">LSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cactus-dev%40jakarta.apache.org/msg04856.html">the cause was found</a>. The hunt is over!
</p><p>
The cause was: <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">commons-httpclient</a>
</p><p>
Cactus works fine with version 2.0 of commons-httpclient but not with the
latest version from HEAD. </p><p>
It turns out that commons-httpclient HEAD (i.e. v3.x) is not going to be backward compatible
with v2.x and thus several APIs will be broken. The question has been
asked on 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cactus-dev%40jakarta.apache.org/">Cactus dev mailing list</a>
as to whether they stay on the 
<a href="http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/commons-httpclient-20-branch/">2.x branch</a>
or follow 3.x.
