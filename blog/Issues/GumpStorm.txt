<B>History Repeating Itself</B>
<P>
About 6-7 years ago I was managing a small website for my mother on a local ISP. 
I had a ~/.foward in ajack@ISP as simple as "ajack@THEN_WORK_ADDRESS.com". Everything was fine until
DNS guy at THEN_WORK_ADDRESS quit, and time went buy w/ unpaid Internic bills. Suddenly that
address was ripped from the Internet, no longer valid [within DNS cache]. 
When a message was sent to ajack@ISP (from me, a CGI script), it was returned (to me) along with a bounce notification. Two problems from one.
Things degraded exponentially! It brought down the ISP (SendMail in a hard in spin), and I was accused of intentional mail bombing. 
Not so, but tonight sure felt the same. :(
</P>
<P>
Today, I disconnected early (lightening putting my sad modem at risk) and I just re-joined. Uh oh ... way to much Gump mail!
</P>
<P>I'd attempted this:<BR/>
	<A HREF="http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=general@gump.apache.org&msgNo=6870">Notification Mail Rework</A><BR/>
Which was intended simply to ensure that Gump was a little more communicative, a little more timely. I way over compensated...
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Ant bootstrap (old faithful, ultra reliable, solid base) failed sending 456 projects into a state that
incorrectly generated an e-mail. Another bad coincidence, another storm. History repeating itself.

<B>Sorry folks...</B>
