<p>Apache 
<a href="http://gump.apache.org">gump</a> is not a top level Apache project.   
Our <a href="http://gump.apache.org/#What+is+Gump%3F">mission</a>

<emp>get diverse projects to communicate early and often about integration, 
dependencies, and versioning management</emp>.  However since gump is now primarily 
written in python and serves a community large than Jakarta we haved moved out on our own.

edit their modules cvs data to keep the builds fresh.
