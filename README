This is a git archive of the Apache Gump project source code. Find
out more about Apache Gump from Apache:

  https://gump.apache.org/

This 'main' branch forks off from the live branch.

The gump project is using Subversion for version control.

This archive was created on October 5th, 2025 using git-svn and svn2git.
Specifically, the approach used was:

 * svn2git https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/ --trunk live
 * fix errors, workaround issues, run some svn2git commands manually
 * git checkout -b main live
 * curl -O https://gitbox.apache.org/authors.txt
 * cat authors.txt | sed -E -e 's/^([^=]+) = (.*)$/\2 \1 <\1@13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68>/g' > author_map.txt
 * git filter-repo --mailmap ../author_map.txt --force

Note this means that

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/metadata/

is not included in this archive. That directory has gump its
project metadata config for the last few years.

Below follows the rest of the README file:

Gump is Apache's continuous integration tool. It is written in python and fully
supports Apache Ant, Apache Maven and other build tools. Gump is unique in that
it builds and compiles software against the latest development versions of
those projects. This allows Gump to detect potentially incompatible changes to
that software just a few hours after those changes are checked into the version
control system. Notifications are sent to the project team as soon as such a
change is detected, referencing more detailed reports available online.

You can set up and run Gump on your own machine and run it on your own
projects, however it is currently most famous for building most of Apache's
java-based projects and their dependencies (which constitutes several million
lines of code split up into hundreds of projects). For this purpose, the Gump
project maintains its own dedicated server.


== Editing Gump descriptors ==

The Gump metadata are currently kept in Subversion repository. When you
perform svn checkout of this directory the metadata are automatically
downloaded thanks to svn:externals property. You can edit them in
metadata/project directory.

Please use our validation command before committing changed descriptors:

   ./gump validate

Remember that the metadata is a Subversion checkout, so commit using

   svn commit -m "Useful message here please!" metadata/

Thanks for helping out!


== More Information ==

Please see our website, http://gump.apache.org/, for more information. You can
also generate that documentation using Apache Forrest. To do so, run

   ./gump site

which will generate the docs in build/site. We are currently using Forrest 0.9,
which you can get from http://forrest.apache.org/.


== Command-Line Interface ==

Gump has a command-based commandline interface. Run

   ./gump help

for more information on the available commands. It's pretty straightforward (we
hope).


== The Gump Blog ==

We maintain a shared blog. See blog/read.me for more information. You're
welcome to contribute!
