   A tiny build file that syncs the generated site with the checked
   out working copy of .../gump/site/ so that you don't have to remember
   to copy files over (or even think about which files have changed).

   Requires Ant 1.7 (CVS of 2005-02 or later will do) in order to have
   sync support the preserveInTarget element.
